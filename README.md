## Advent of Chuck

Chuck Norris jokes in an advent calendar format.

Simple app to showcase some feel-good animations ðŸ¤© made with React + CSS.

Based on a **jokes API which is no longer available** :(

>
> If you want the feel-good experience for yourself, even **without the API working**, feel free to edit `useFacts.js` to make it return real Chuck Norris facts.
> 
> ðŸ”¥ **PRO TIP** ðŸ¤“ Use Github copilot to construct an array of facts, it will amazingly spit out fact after fact.
> Now you know - Chuck Norris facts have to be in the arsenal of a good programmer.
